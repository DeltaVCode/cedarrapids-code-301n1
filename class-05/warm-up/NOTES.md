# Overview of today's warm-up challenge

Today's warmup is intended to give students practice working with larger JSON structures with lots of nested objects and arrays.

Split them into breakout rooms of 2 students each for 15 minutes. Encourage them to complete as many as they can, increasing the difficulty level after every correct answer.
