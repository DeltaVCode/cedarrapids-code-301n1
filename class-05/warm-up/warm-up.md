# Warm-Up Exercise

Complete as many exercises as you can from [this website](https://erty.me/access/). You will be asked to practice drilling down into JSON data, in order to read the specified value.

For instance, it will ask you to "Find: 'u'" in a JSON structure that looks like this:

```js
var struct = [
  [
    "u"
  ]
]
```

In which you would type into the box:

```js
struct[0][0]
```

and click the "Check Answer" button.

Use the "Difficulty" slider bar below to adjust the difficulty level and challenge yourself!

You will have 15 minutes in breakout rooms to complete as many as you can.
