# Deploy and Extend Your Portfolio

## Overview

Get ready to take a look at a full-featured code base! You have just started a new job and the employer wants you to demonstrate your skills by building a portfolio using React.  This should highlight your knowledge of the React library and your ability to explore a new codebase.  [The starter template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cra-template-react-portfolio){:target="_blank"} for today contains a complete React + Bootstrap site with example pages, icons, styles, and a themed layouts. Your job is to customize this code by following the specifications in the Trello board.

You will be deploying your React portfolio to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/){:target="_blank"}.

## Workflow

- We will be using the [Trello](https://trello.com/home){:target="_blank"} project management tool for this lab.
- To maximize your experience with Trello, you should create a free Trello account by clicking on the `Sign Up` button.
- After creating an account, open the [React Portfolio Board](https://trello.com/b/BEvm5LDn/react-portfolio){:target="_blank"}, open the "... Show Menu" link, click the "... More" link, and then click "Copy Board". Before you create it, be sure to "Change" from Private to "Public" (and click "Yes, Make Board Public") so your instructional team can see your work.
