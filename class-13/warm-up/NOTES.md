# Overview of today's warm-up challenge

Here is a list of errors:

* missing: `super(props)`
* `age` should have a starting value of the data type of what it is (ie 0)
* `pets` should be an array not an object
* `this.setState({ age: this.state.age + 1})`
* `{this.name}` should be `{this.state.name}`
* the <ul> should `map` over the array not `forEach`
* the `.map` is missing the unique key
* missing the `return`
* needs a parent element to wrap everything
