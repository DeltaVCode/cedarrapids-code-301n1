//3. Define the Modal so that we can write code to the mongoose and 'use' the schema.

//bring in mongoose
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

//Define our model
//this is what will give our database functionality. It will assign the predefined schema to shape our data.
//this method takes in two properties a string and a schema:
